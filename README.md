# Archery Fees Financial Projection

This represents my first serious play with [D3](https://d3js.org/), and what a cracking little library it is too!

[Witchford Archers](http://witchfordarchers.club/) are nothing if not transparent so we've created this tool to illustrate just what we can afford to pay for a venue in which to shoot. It's not a huge amount is it? Especially if we plan to break even and pay for [Archery GB](http://www.archerygb.org/) memberships for our members.

Updated figures are stored in a URL hash so you can navigate through your history and share your projections - who knows, it might be useful to another archery club.

It's live [here](witchfordarchers.drmsite.com/fees/).
